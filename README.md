# Adriuno-based-under-water-comunication
Arduino-based underwater communication uses optical or acoustic signals to transmit data where RF fails. LEDs or ultrasonic transducers send signals, while photodiodes or receivers decode them. Ideal for short-range, submerged data exchange in research and monitoring.
